The file `translations.txt` can be used if the text needs to be translated into languages other than the default one.<br><br>The default language may be multilingual for datasets with the original text in multiple languages. In such cases, the `feed_lang` field should contain the language code `mul` defined by the norm ISO 639-2. The best practice here would be to provide, in `translations.txt`, a translation for each language used throughout the dataset. If all the original text in the dataset is in the same language, then `mul` should not be used.<hr>_Example: Consider a dataset from a multilingual country like Switzerland, with the original `stops.stop_name` field populated with stop names in different languages. Each stop name is written according to the dominant language in that stop’s geographic location, e.g. `Genève` for the French-speaking city of Geneva, `Zürich` for the German-speaking city of Zurich, and `Biel/Bienne` for the bilingual city of Biel/Bienne. The dataset `feed_lang` should be `mul` and translations would be provided in `translations.txt`, in German: `Genf`, `Zürich` and `Biel`; in French: `Genève`, `Zurich` and `Bienne`; in Italian: `Ginevra`, `Zurigo` and `Bienna`; and in English: `Geneva`, `Zurich` and `Biel/Bienne`._",
